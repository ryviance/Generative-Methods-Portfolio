        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My goal with this experiment was to dabble a little into generative design and make a little personalized wacky and
          goofy story generator about cooking. The result is pretty entertaining. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="minor-section">
        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>I took original project that generated stories and replaced the strings in each of the lists in the fillers constant. 
          I also tried rewording the sentence in the template to see what it would generate! It was pretty goofy and interesting. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="minor-section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I worked on this project by myself and it was mostly review since I was familiar with using Github as well as HTML/CSS and 
          JavaScript. The annoying part for me was actually using Glitch as I kept getting an error that didn’t let me preview my project. 
          I tried solving this by searching online and looking at online forums and reddit. Everyone had the same issue and suggested deleting 
          the cache. I did that as well as all my browsing history, which was inconvenient since I had to relog into all my accounts, 
          and it didn’t fix the issue. Ultimately, I just finished the entire project in VS Code and got it done.
