# Procedural Generative Methods Showcase
This is a portfolio website showcasing small projects I've worked on while attending a class emphasizing on generative design. Some basic techniques used are mathematical functions, noise, weighted probability, seeded randomness, binary space partitioning, and symbol mapping. 

## Features
This repository houses a site with sublinks to several "Experiments," which each are individual assignments I've completed on a weekly basis that highlight generative design. Each experiment has an interactable demo that the user can fiddle with. There is a technical description explaining how the demo works on the back-end, as well as a post-reflection after I've completed the project.
