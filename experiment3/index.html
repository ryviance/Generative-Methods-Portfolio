        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project creates 2 randomly generated tile-based worlds using a seeded system. Each time you click "Reseed," a new world layout appears, 
          filled with grass, trees, houses, and ocassionally white houses. For the dungeon, there are different chest rarities, doors, and hallways.
          The world is visualized with tiles and also represented in ASCII form, making it easily visualized. Itâ€™s an interesting way to experiment 
          with procedural generation and see how small changes in the seed can shape an entire map.</p>

        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>This sketch uses p5.js to build a tile-based ASCII environment. Tiles are drawn from a pixel art tileset and updated based on the seed. You 
          can also manually edit the world using the ASCII textbox below each world. For the overworld, - is grass, ^ is tree, H is red house, M is white
          house. For the dungeon, # is wall, . is room/hallway, D is door, C is silver chest, T is black chest, G is gold chest.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project helped me understand how randomness, noise seeds, and procedural generation work together in creative coding. I also thought thought
          the ASCII generation was a super interesting yet simplistic and ingenuous way to represent procedural generation. I didn't realize it was kind of
          less complicated than I thought! Each randomly procedurally generated structure or object can have a different heuristic, mathematical function, logic,
          or just randomness probability.
