        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>I added 6 layers using noise functions, and a plant function, tree function, and 
			cloud function to add depth to the world. Each function utilizes a different
			mathematical function, wheter it's a noise function or a random number
			generator.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="minor-section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I worked on this project by myself and it was mostly review since I was familiar 
			with using Github as well as HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This time, I completely 
			skipped Glitch and went straight into VSCode to do my programming. I understand 
			the instructor’s concern and desire for us to sandbox in Glitch, but the UI/UX 
			on the site is so horrible and it takes so long to load that it was actually 
			detrimental to my progress working on the assignment. Going forward, I plan on 
			doing all experiments completely in VSCode. Because I attended class and watched 
			the professor’s video on the man generating a pixar character entirely out of 
			math, I was super inspired and had a lot of ideas to use math for generative 
			design. From the trees, the terrain, the plants, the clouds, all of the layers, 
			I used some sort of math function or random number generator to do this. 
			Ultimately, this assignment taught me a lot about the use of math functions and 
			equations and how viable they are when paired with generative design.</p>
